# Customer Segmentation

Customer Segmentation is a data science project that leverages machine learning to group customers based on their behaviors and characteristics. This project helps businesses understand their customer base and design targeted marketing strategies for improved engagement and ROI.

## Project Description

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers into meaningful groups. By analyzing customer data, it uncovers patterns and similarities that allow businesses to:
- Personalize marketing campaigns
- Improve customer retention
- Optimize resource allocation

## Tools Used

- **Python 3.x:** Primary programming language for all analysis and modeling tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for code, visualization, and documentation.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy:** Efficient numerical computing and array operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Visualization libraries for plotting data insights.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for clustering algorithms like K-Means.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares customer data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes and summarizes key patterns in the data.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Implements clustering methods such as K-Means to discover customer segments.
- **Visualization:** Presents findings with clear and insightful plots and charts.
- **Actionable Insights:** Interprets clusters to suggest business strategies for each segment.

## Project Structure

- Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step analysis and modeling.
- Data files for input and output (not provided in this public repo).
- Visualization outputs for reporting insights.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmrKhaled05/Customer-Segmentation.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file(s) in your environment.
3. Follow along with the analysis and adapt it to your own dataset as needed.

## Applications
